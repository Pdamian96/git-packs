Collection of some of my datapacks.
I dont usually comment stuff unless needed, and I wont update this extra folder too often.

Balls: (Version 1.20.4) (Breaks in 1.21)
 - Datapack for towny server
 - Nethergold gets smelted to Gold nuggets
 - Netergold cant be broken with fortune and drops 1-2 nuggets instead of 2-6
 - Newly Crafted Netherite doesnt have knockback reesistance.

Gold-Nerf: (Version 1.20.4) (Breaks in 1.21)
 - Same functionality as the "balls" Datapack but removes the netherite Knock resistance nerf

gun-datapack: (Only 1.21)
 - Resourcepack is in the repo too called "gun-resourcepack" (very importat)
 - Adds 5 different types of guns and 3 Grenades (at the moment)
 - Highly WIP
 - Made to be as lag free as possible
 - Multiplayer Friendly
 - Grenades are still buggy
 - To get guns do: /function guns:give_guns
